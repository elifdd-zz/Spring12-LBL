This directory contains:
     - the batch scripts
     - the python and java programs 


These are used to load the input data to mongoDB.
Before running the mongoDB-Hadoop benchmarks the batch script should be put into the queue and executed to load the target data set.

Simply change the inputdir in the batch script for the file you want to load.
